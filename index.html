        <p>There are two envelopes. In the envelope handed to you there is definitely ${{amount}}.  In the other envelope, there is either ${{amount * 2}} or $0.  Whether or not the other envelope contains ${{amount * 2}} or $0 on this particular occasion has already been decided, say by toss of fair coin (i.e. it's random), and so the other envelope already contains either ${{amount * 2}} or $0, each outcome being 50% likely.</p>
        <p>Do you KEEP or SWAP?</p>
