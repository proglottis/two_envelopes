    <h2>Scenario 1</h2>

    <p>There are two envelopes. In the envelope handed to you there is definitely $X.  In the other envelope, there is either $2X or $0.  Whether or not the other envelope contains $2X or $0 on this particular occasion has already been decided, say by toss of fair coin (i.e. it's random), and so the other envelope already contains either $2X or $0, each outcome being 50% likely.</p>
    <p>Do you KEEP or SWAP?</p>
