  <h2>The "double-or-half" envelope game</h2>

  <p>There are two envelopes. In the envelope handed to you there is definitely {{amount | currency}}.  Whether the other envelope contains {{amount * 2 | currency}} or {{amount / 2 | currency}} on any particular occasion is decided by flipping a fair coin, so half the time the other envelope will yield {{amount * 2 | currency}} and half of the time it will yield {{amount / 2 | currency}}.</p>
  <p>Do you KEEP or SWAP?</p>
