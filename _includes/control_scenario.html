  <h2>The boring envelope game</h2>

  <p>There are two envelopes. In the envelope handed to you there is definitely {{amount | currency}}.  In the other envelope, there is either {{amount * 2 | currency}} or {{0 | currency}}.  Whether or not the other envelope contains {{amount * 2 | currency}} or {{0 | currency}} on this particular occasion has already been decided, say by toss of fair coin (i.e. it's random), and so the other envelope already contains either {{amount * 2 | currency}} or {{0 | currency}}, each outcome being 50% likely.</p>
  <p>As the story goes, you can either KEEP the amount of money that's in your envelope, whichever amount it is &mdash; call it X &mdash; or you can SWAP your envelope for the other envelope, switching X for either 2X or X/2.</p>
  <p>Do you KEEP or SWAP?</p>
